# Digilompakko 🇫🇮

> Open-source **EUDI digital identity wallet** demo — issuer + wallet + verifier — aligned with the
> EU **Architecture & Reference Framework (ARF) 2.x** and the **OpenID4VC High Assurance
> Interoperability Profile (HAIP) 1.0**.

This project demonstrates the complete **issue → hold → present → verify** flow for a European
Digital Identity Wallet using **both credential formats** — **SD-JWT VC** and **ISO 18013-5 mdoc /
mDL** — over **OpenID4VCI** and **OpenID4VP**, with real selective disclosure, ES256 holder binding,
revocation, signed request objects, and a WSCD key-storage boundary.

It exists alongside Finland's *Suomi.fi Wallet* (being procured by DVV under eIDAS 2.0) as an
approachable, readable TypeScript reference. **It is a learning/conformance reference, not a
certified production wallet** — see [`docs/COMPLIANCE.md` §6](docs/COMPLIANCE.md) for the honest gap
list.

## Why it's "spec compliant"

Compliance is a *stack*, not one document. This repo implements the core of it and documents the rest:

| Concern | Standard | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Credential format A | IETF **SD-JWT VC** (`dc+sd-jwt`), selective disclosure | ✅ |
| Credential format B | **ISO 18013-5 mdoc / mDL** (`mso_mdoc`, CBOR/COSE) | ✅ |
| Holder / device binding | `cnf` + **Key Binding JWT** · mdoc **DeviceAuth** | ✅ |
| Issuance | **OpenID4VCI 1.0** — pre-auth + **Authorization Code + PAR + PKCE** | ✅ |
| Presentation | **OpenID4VP 1.0** + **DCQL**, both formats | ✅ |
| Request authenticity | **signed request objects** (JAR, RFC 9101) | ✅ |
| Crypto suite | **ES256 / P-256** (HAIP) | ✅ |
| Revocation | **IETF Token Status List** — SD-JWT VC **and** mdoc | ✅ |
| Trust resolution | pluggable resolver + static trusted list | ✅ |
| Key-storage boundary | **WSCD** abstraction (software keystore) | ✅ |
| RP governance | registration + attribute-entitlement gate | ✅ |
| Hardware WSCD, real trusted lists, proximity (BLE/NFC), certification | — | ⬜ roadmap |

Full mapping with requirement traceability: **[`docs/COMPLIANCE.md`](docs/COMPLIANCE.md)**,
**[`docs/TRACEABILITY.md`](docs/TRACEABILITY.md)** (capability → code → test), and
**[`docs/CONFORMANCE.md`](docs/CONFORMANCE.md)** (how to run the external conformance suites), and
**[`docs/PRODUCTIONIZATION.md`](docs/PRODUCTIONIZATION.md)** (what a real Suomi.fi Wallet needs beyond this reference).

## Architecture

```
ISSUER ──OpenID4VCI──▶ WALLET ──OpenID4VP──▶ VERIFIER
(PID provider)         (holder)              (relying party)
            shared crypto + SD-JWT VC: packages/core
```

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install

# Run the headless end-to-end proof (no servers needed):
npm run demo

# Run the test suite (selective disclosure, replay, holder binding, tamper):
npm test

# Or run the three services + open the wallet UI:
npm start
# then visit http://localhost:4000
```

In the UI: get a **PID** (pre-auth or Authorization Code + PAR + PKCE) or an **mDL** (`mso_mdoc`),
tick which claims to share, and **Present** to the verifier. The wallet first verifies the verifier's
signed request object, then returns exactly — and only — the claims you disclosed.

## Layout

```
packages/core   trust-critical library: crypto, SD-JWT VC, mdoc (CBOR/COSE), Token Status List,
                trust resolver, WSCD keystore, PKCE, RP registry, signed request objects, errors
apps/issuer     OpenID4VCI 1.0 issuer — pre-auth + Auth Code/PAR/PKCE, status list (port 4001)
apps/verifier   OpenID4VP 1.0 verifier — DCQL, trust, revocation, signed requests (port 4002)
apps/wallet     holder wallet + web UI (port 4000)
scripts/demo.ts headless end-to-end demo (both formats)
mobile/         native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) + Android (Kotlin/Compose) wallets — see mobile/README.md
docs/           COMPLIANCE · ARCHITECTURE · ROADMAP · TRACEABILITY · CONFORMANCE · PRODUCTIONIZATION
```

## Native mobile wallets

Native **iOS (Swift)** and **Android (Kotlin)** holder apps live in [`mobile/`](mobile/README.md).
They run the same OpenID4VCI / OpenID4VP flows with **hardware-backed keys** — iOS **Secure Enclave**
and Android **StrongBox** — and a polished selective-disclosure UI. They issue and present **SD-JWT VC**
against the demo services today; mdoc is the next milestone. See [`mobile/README.md`](mobile/README.md)
for build/run instructions.

## Revocation demo

Works for both formats — the PID (SD-JWT VC) and the mDL (mdoc, status reference in the MSO):

```bash
npm start
# obtain a credential in the UI (or: curl -X POST localhost:4000/api/get-credential)
curl -X POST localhost:4001/admin/revoke -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"idx":0}'
# present again -> verifier now returns valid:false with "credential_revoked"
```

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. **Please read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
first** — all changes use a **worktree + PR-into-`main`** workflow, Conventional Commits, and must
keep `npm run build` and `npm test` green. The [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) lists what's next — mostly
the real-world track (hardware WSCD, real PID/eID, live trusted lists, proximity, certification) plus
remaining protocol refinements (full 18013-5 SessionTranscript + `deviceMac`, response encryption).
Keep trust-critical code in `packages/core` with tests. See also [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
